# About LifeLine

[LifeLine](https://davidfpease.github.io/LifeLine/) is a graphical representation of a human life displayed as weeks.  Inspired by this [blog post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), LifeLine depicts 100 years of life as columns of 52 weeks -- each column represents one full year --  for a total of 5,200 weeks.  Visitors may enter their birthday to see their current week and life-expectancy week derived from global life expectancy data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN).  

# About this page

This page is built with vanilla Javascript, WebPack and [D3js](https://d3js.org/).  I used John Walley's [simple sliders](https://bl.ocks.org/johnwalley/e1d256b81e51da68f7feb632a53c3518) for the birthday input sliders.
